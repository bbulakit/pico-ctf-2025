Description
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. 
I want to make sure they get the real thing! 
I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to 
help you know that my flags are legitimate. ssh -p 64977 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net 
Using the password 1db87a14. Accept the fingerprint with yes, 
and ls once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!

    To decrypt the file once you've verified the hash, run ./decrypt.sh files/<file>.
