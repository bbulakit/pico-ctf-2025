### Description

```
I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead? You can download the challenge files here:

    challenge.zip

The same files are accessible via SSH here: ssh -p 60585 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net Using the password 6abf4a82. Accept the fingerprint with yes, and ls once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!
